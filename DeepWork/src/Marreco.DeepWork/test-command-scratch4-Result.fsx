(* 
 * Simple Example of CQRS in F# using Free Monads
 * ==============================================
 *   The goal is to create simple basic commands that define an algebra 
 * for our data type; More complex commands will be built by composing these
 * base commands much like lego.
 *
 * Domain:  
 *    We will work with a very simple domain of a bank account, in which the
 *  following actions can be peformed:
 * 
 *  - Accounts can be created, associated with a client 
 *  - A client can have multiple accounts, but only one market as "Prefered"
 *  - A deposit can be made to any account
 *  - The account balance cannot become negative (overdraft)
 *)
